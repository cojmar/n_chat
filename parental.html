				<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">In order to help enforce our terms and assist in restricting access to minors, we have ensured that EmuChat is, and remains <a href="https://www.rtalabel.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RTA [Restricted to Adults]</a> compliant, and allows every page to be blocked by simple parental control tools.</p>
				<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">We urge parents to monitor their children’s online activity and implement parental controls as appropriate to keep their children safe in the digital age. We firmly believe that parents are best placed to police their children’s activity using the plethora of tools already available in modern operating systems and devices.</p>
				<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">We have set out below some simple guidelines and advice on how to limit the potential for your child to access inappropriate content&nbsp;.</p>

					<p>There are many tools available for parents to make the internet safer for their children. ISPs, device manufacturers, and operating system developers have ensured an easy route to setting up parental controls. They all use simple step-by-step instructions which you only need to follow once, giving you control over your children’s browsing habits beyond simple supervision.</p>
					<p>EmuChat’s Restricted to Adults tags ensure that all such controls can automatically block our site when enabled by parents.</p>

							<p>All modern operating systems have built-in parental controls and they are simple to activate requiring only a few minutes to setup. Microsoft Windows 10 for instance, allows parents to easily setup accounts for their children, restrict which apps and programs they can open, and block inappropriate websites at the touch of a button.</p>
							<p>Visit the <a href="https://family.microsoft.com/"><em>Microsoft Family Safety</em></a> site for more information.</p>
							<p>Apple devices such as Macs, iPads, and iPhones have similar parental controls which can be enabled by following the instructions on Apple’s dedicated <a href="https://www.apple.com/families/"><em>Families site</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>

						<div class="accordion__item-content">
							<p>As many children use their own personal devices to access the internet, mobile operating systems now include tools to ensure parents can stay firmly in control of their children’s browsing habits.</p>
							<p>iOS devices from Apple such as iPhones and iPads can block inappropriate content, set screen time limits and prevent apps from being installed without permission. More information is available on Apple’s dedicated <em><a href="https://www.apple.com/families/" target="_self">Families site</a>.</em></p>
							<p>Android products such as smartphones and tablets contain similar protections, allowing parents to choose what their children can see and do on their personal devices. The <a href="https://safety.google/families/"><em>Google Safety Centre</em></a> will walk you through the setup process.</p>

Such services block all traffic to inappropriate websites and can usually be enabled by logging into your ISP account online. Simply contact your ISP and they can advise how to enable their content blocks.</p>
